"""Nano system prompt — pi's shape, clawcodex's plumbing.

Builds the entire nano system prompt as a block list compatible with
``query()``'s cache machinery (same ``_cache_scope`` / ``cache_control``
conventions as ``build_full_system_prompt_blocks`` and the coordinator
branch of ``build_effective_system_prompt``).

Structure, mirroring pi (`packages/coding-agent/src/core/system-prompt.ts`,
162 lines for the whole builder):

  identity line
  Available tools:   (one line per tool)
  Guidelines:        (a handful of bullets)
  [non-interactive note]
  [project context — CLAWCODEX.md, falling back to AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md]
  [skills listing — name/description/location; the Read tool is the loader]
  Current working directory + OS + date

Deliberately absent (the point of nano — see
my-docs/clawcodex-nano/pi-vs-clawcodex.md §3): the ~3,000-token base
sections, the ~3,300-token auto-memory doctrine, MCP sections, the git
status snapshot, and every per-turn reminder. Everything here is
session-stable, so the whole prompt sits in one cached prefix.
